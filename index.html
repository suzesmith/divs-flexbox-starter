                <p>I was born in Adelaide, Australia. I have connected to many people and places around the world. Now due to the pandemic that is changing how we live, I am back in my home town. I haven't lived here since I was 17 years old. That's over 30 years ago now.  </p>

            <div class="div-2">
                <p>Currently on round two quarantine, I'm holed up in an airbnb by the beach at Henley. I can hear the waves, smell the salt, and watch the people passing by dog walking and exercising. It is a strange time in the world. I keep reminding myself no one is left unaffected. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                <p>I left my partner in Berkeley, California, three and a half weeks ago. She is immersed in the struggle to keep her family business afloat. The distance is growing between us now. I guess this was inevitable. As she buries herself in work, I see her just before she sleeps each night on whatsapp. </p>
